                    <p className="text-white">I am currently a student at the ESCUELA POLITECNICA NACIONAL EPN on 4 of 6 semesters in Software Development career. <br />
                    I enter coding and web development and APP desktop aplications. <br />Fast forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of building software for multiple customers as a tire company.<br></br>
                    My main focus these days is building products and leading projects for our customers. <br />In my spare time I also like to create videos related to programming and teaching.<br></br>
                    When Iâ€™m not at the computer, I go running and playing football ðŸ™Œ
